1) lt jars should be added to MR for creating mavenized project. (note: add name of jars)
2) a jar file should be added to MR 
   if aWebService will be used then certificate of this webservice should be added to java key store
   ( also on my local  for completing integ part of the development process).
3) LoadFromStream method of ld DocumentFactory class  can not create LeadDocument from stream [INVESTIGATING].(note: add sc )
4) This JAX-RS rest api should be separate or be part of existed project? 
   it can be hosted on the different port because this rest api will be consumed by frontend app
   and it doesn't have dependency from existed app.
   Is Tomcat allowed for hosting of this rest api or only OWL?
 5) Frontend application will send 2 parameters 'userid' and 'imgid' to this api for retriving document.
 6) Somehow ang comp should be embedded to appropriate jsp pages and 'userid' and 'imgid' should be binded to this ang comp.
